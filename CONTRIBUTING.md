# Contributing

Do you want to contribute? We'd love that.

Our goal is to have mostly projects that are stable and useful to many users.

## How?

The easiest way is to go to https://github.com/axonasif/awesome-android-x86/blob/master/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the upper right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider this:

- is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done in Android-x86?
- if you want to add something, please use the template `[ACCOUNT/REPO](https://github.com/ACCOUNT/REPO) [[ADDITIONAL-LINKS-IF-AVAILABLE](https://...)] â€” DESCRIPTION`
    * if you have a CI build, please add the build badge. Put the image after the description, separated by a space. Please make sure to add the branch information to the image:
       * example for Travis: ` [<img src="https://api.travis-ci.org/XXX/CRATE.svg?branch=master">](https://travis-ci.org/XXX/YYY)`
       * for Github actions please see https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/managing-workflow-runs/adding-a-workflow-status-badge#using-the-branch-parameter
- please pay attention to the alphabetical ordering.


## Removing projects

We don't remove projects unless they are outright broken or pronounced deprecated by another project or by its author.
